Real-time phase detection and phase-specific stimulation system. For more introduction of the project, see its [project page](https://jhanliufu.github.io/projects/closed_loop_control.html) on Jhan's website.

- **[trodes_connection.py](trodes_connection.py)** contains functions to interface with the [Trodes](https://spikegadgets.com/) system. We stream local field potential (LFP) signal from Trodes and issue stimulation command to Trodes.
